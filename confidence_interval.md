# Confidence Interval Calculation for Optimizer Accuracy

This document outlines the steps to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the accuracy of our optimizer that selects the correct order of operators in plan execution.

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### 1. Determine the Sample Proportion (p)
- The optimizer selects the correct order 96% of the time.
- Therefore, the sample proportion \( p \) is:

  $$p = 0.96$$

### 2. Determine the Sample Size (n)
- The sample size \( n \) is the number of cases tested:

  $$n = 1000$$

### 3. Choose the Confidence Level
- For a 95% confidence level, the Z-score \( Z \) is approximately 1.96.

### 4. Calculate the Standard Error (SE)
- The standard error for a proportion is calculated using the formula:

  $$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1 - p)}{n}}$$
  
- Plugging in the values:

   $$SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.96 \times (1 - 0.96)}{1000}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.96 \times 0.04}{1000}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.0384}{1000}} = \sqrt{0.0000384} \approx 0.0062$$

### 5. Calculate the Margin of Error (ME)
- The margin of error is calculated using the formula:

   $$ME = Z \times SE$$
  
- For a 95% confidence level, \( Z = 1.96 \):
  
   $$ME = 1.96 \times 0.0062 \approx 0.0121$$

### 6. Determine the Confidence Interval (CI)
- The confidence interval is calculated as:

   $$\text{CI} = p \pm ME$$
  
- Plugging in the values:

   $$\text{CI} = 0.96 \pm 0.0121$$
  
- This gives:
  
   $$\text{CI} = (0.9479, 0.9721)$$


## Interpretation
- The 95% confidence interval for the optimizer's accuracy is **(94.79%, 97.21%)**.
- This means that we can be 95% confident that the true accuracy of the optimizer is between 94.79% and 97.21%.

## Conclusion
- The calculated confidence interval provides a range in which the true accuracy of the optimizer is likely to fall, giving us a measure of the optimizer's reliability and consistency.
