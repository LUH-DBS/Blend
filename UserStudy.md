# User Study
We conducted a survey and obtained results from 18 participants (40% response rate) covering diverse sectors, such as health care, banking, technology, and universities. We aimed to understand preferences, needs, and challenges in data discovery and let participants choose between different implementations of simple and complex pipelines.

The questionaire was divided into two sections:
1. Background information on the participants
2. Questions on data discovery

Below we present the results of the survey, including the participants' roles, the industries they represent, their familiarity with programming languages, and their preferences for data discovery tools and methods.

## Section 1: Background Information
In order to gain insight into the participants' backgrounds and the potential influence of their roles and industries on their preferences and needs in data discovery, we asked them about their area of work and roles within their organizations.

### Question 1: What type of industry (education, finance, automotive, ...) do you belong to?
In order to group the participants according to their area of work, we asked them about their type of industry they belong to.
#### Results (from free text input)
| Answer                     | Count | Area of Work  |
|----------------------------|-------|---------------|
| Academia, applied projects | 1     | Research      |
| Education                  | 6     | Research      |
| Research                   | 2     | Research      |
| Automotive                 | 2     | Industry      |
| Finance                    | 3     | Industry      |
| Finance and business       | 1     | Industry      |
| Healthcare                 | 1     | Industry      |
| IoT                        | 1     | Industry      |
| Software industry          | 1     | Industry      |

Based on their answers we have grouped the 18 participants into two categories: Research and Industry. Research includes participants from academia, applied projects, and education. Industry includes participants from the automotive, finance, healthcare, IoT, and software industry.

- Use some open source tool to navigate the sources.
- _Other (please specify)._

#### Results

![Method of solving data discovery problems stacked bar chart](images/method_stacked.svg)

The majority of participants (77.8%) solve their data discovery problems manually, by writing scripts and visually inspecting the data. 50% of the participants use SQL queries to understand the content of the data. The Research group relies more on manual work (100%) compared to the Industry group (55.6%). The Industry group uses SQL queries more often (55.6%) compared to the Research group (44.4%).

### Question 6: How often do you find the required dataset with a single search?
#### Single-Choice

### Question 11: Which of the following discovery task types are most similar to your data discovery needs?
#### Multiple-Choice
1.  Discover tables that contain a set of rows, e.g., <"Germany", "Berlin", "TXL">, <"France", "Paris", "CDG">
2.  Discover tables that are joinable with the "movie_title" column
3.  Discover tables that contain the following keywords: "Germany", "Bayern Munich", and "Manuel Neuer".
4.  Find tables that are not only joinable with "movie_title" but also contain the "director names" in a column.
5.  Find tables that contain a correlating column to the target column, that can benefit the downstream ML model.

#### Results
![Discovery needs stacked bar chart](images/needs_stacked.svg)

With regard to the prevalence of discovery task types, participants commonly selected complex tasks. The two most common tasks were discovering tables containing a set of rows and containing a correlating column to a target. According to our participant breakdown, these complex tasks are more prevalent in industry. 


### Question 12: Which implementation do you find favorable?
Consider a data discovery task that enables us to enrich the table at hand to increase the accuracy of the ML model in predicting the IMDB score of movies:

Task: Find tables that are not only joinable with "movie_title" but also contain the "director names" in a column. These tables should also contain a useful column, i.e., correlating column to the target column, that can benefit the downstream ML model.

Please examine the two following implementations of the task.
The first implementation leverages a library that provides a specific abstraction for data discovery operators. The second implementation leverages Python and Pandas dataframes to discover the desired tables.
